;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides an API for 'entry' type which is just an alist of
;; KEY/VALUE pairs (KEY should be a symbol) with the required 'id' KEY.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'guix-utils)

(defalias 'guix-entry-value #'guix-assq-value)

(defun guix-entry-id (entry)
  "Return ENTRY ID."
  (guix-entry-value entry 'id))

(defun guix-entry-by-id (id entries)
  "Return an entry from ENTRIES by its ID."
  (cl-find-if (lambda (entry)
                (equal (guix-entry-id entry) id))
              entries))

(defun guix-entries-by-ids (ids entries)
  "Return entries with IDS (a list of identifiers) from ENTRIES."
  (cl-remove-if-not (lambda (entry)
                      (member (guix-entry-id entry) ids))
                    entries))

(defun guix-replace-entry (id new-entry entries)
  "Replace an entry with ID from ENTRIES by NEW-ENTRY.
Return a list of entries with the replaced entry."
  (cl-substitute-if new-entry
                    (lambda (entry)
                      (equal id (guix-entry-id entry)))
                    entries
                    :count 1))
