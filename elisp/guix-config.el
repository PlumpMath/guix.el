;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides configuration variables for Emacs-Guix package.
;; It is actually just a wrapper for either `guix-build-config' or
;; `guix-default-config'.  Why?  Well, when Emacs-Guix is built using
;; the GNU Build System (./configure and make), "guix-build-config.el"
;; file is generated, se we can use it.  But when Emacs-Guix is used
;; without building (e.g., from MELPA), we don't have this file, so
;; instead, there is "guix-default-config.el" with the same variables.

;;; Code:

(or (require 'guix-build-config nil t)
    (require 'guix-default-config))

(provide 'guix-config)

;;; guix-config.el ends here
