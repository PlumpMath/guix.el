;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides configuration variables for Emacs-Guix package.
;; Mainly, it is a wrapper for either `guix-build-config' or
;; `guix-default-config'.  Why?  Well, when Emacs-Guix is built using
;; the GNU Build System (./configure and make), "guix-build-config.el"
;; file is generated, se we can use it.  But when Emacs-Guix is used
;; without building (e.g., from MELPA), we don't have this file, so
;; instead, there is "guix-default-config.el" with the same variables.

;;; Code:

(or (require 'guix-build-config nil t)
    (require 'guix-default-config))

;; Avoid compilation warnings.
(defvar guix-config-scheme-directory)

(defvar guix-scheme-directory
  ;; If `guix-config-scheme-directory' is nil, then Emacs-Guix is used
  ;; from source without building (i.e., from MELPA), so find Scheme
  ;; files in a relative directory.
  (or guix-config-scheme-directory
      (let* ((elisp-dir  (file-name-directory load-file-name))
             (scheme-dir (expand-file-name "scheme" elisp-dir)))
        (if (file-exists-p scheme-dir)
            scheme-dir
          (let ((scheme-dir (expand-file-name "../scheme" elisp-dir)))
            (if (file-exists-p scheme-dir)
                scheme-dir
              (message "WARNING: Can't define `guix-scheme-directory'!")
              nil)))))
