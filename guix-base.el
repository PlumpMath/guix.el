  "Define common stuff for BUF-TYPE buffers for displaying entries.

ENTRY-TYPE is a type of displayed entries (see
`guix-search-entries-config').

In the text below TYPE means ENTRY-TYPE-BUF-TYPE.

This macro defines `guix-TYPE-mode', a custom group, several user
variables and the following functions:

  - `guix-TYPE-get-params-for-receiving'
  - `guix-TYPE-revert'
  - `guix-TYPE-redisplay'
  - `guix-TYPE-make-history-item'
  - `guix-TYPE-set'
  - `guix-TYPE-show'
  - `guix-TYPE-get-show'

The following stuff should be defined outside this macro:

  - `guix-BUF-TYPE-mode' - parent mode for the defined mode.

  - `guix-BUF-TYPE-insert-entries' - function for inserting
  entries in the current buffer; it is called with 2 arguments:
  entries of the form of `guix-entries' and ENTRY-TYPE.

  - `guix-BUF-TYPE-get-displayed-params' - function returning a
  list of parameters displayed in the current buffer; it is
  called with ENTRY-TYPE as argument.

  - `guix-TYPE-mode-initialize' (optional) - function for
  additional mode settings; it is called without arguments.

Remaining argument (ARGS) should have a form [KEYWORD VALUE] ...  The
following keywords are available:

  - `:required' - default value for the defined
    `guix-TYPE-required-params' variable.

  - `:history-size' - default value for the defined
    `guix-TYPE-history-size' variable.

  - `:revert' - default value for the defined
    `guix-TYPE-revert-no-confirm' variable."
