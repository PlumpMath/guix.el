;;; Commentary:

;; This package is under development.  The goal is to make a
;; full-featured Emacs interface for Guix package manager
;; <http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/>.

;; Currently the package provides an interface for searching, listing
;; and getting information about Guix packages.

;; To install this package, add the following to your init-file:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/guix-dir")
;;   (autoload 'guix-search-by-name "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-search-by-regexp "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-all-available-packages "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-newest-available-packages "guix" nil t)

;;; Code:

(require 'guix-list)

(defgroup guix nil
  "Interface for Guix package manager."
  :prefix "guix-"
  :group 'external)

(defvar guix-search-params '(name synopsis description)
  "Default list of parameters for searching by regexp.
Parameters are symbols from `guix-param-alist'.")

(defvar guix-search-history nil
  "A history of minibuffer prompts.")

;;;###autoload
(defun guix-search-by-name (name)
  "Search for Guix packages by NAME.
NAME is a string with name specification.  It may optionally contain
a version number.  Examples: \"guile\", \"guile-2.0.11\"."
  (interactive
   (list (read-string "Package name: " nil 'guix-search-history)))
  (guix-list-get-show-packages 'name name))

;;;###autoload
(defun guix-search-by-regexp (regexp &rest params)
  "Search for Guix packages by REGEXP.
PARAMS are package parameters that should be searched.
If PARAMS are not specified, use `guix-search-params'."
  (interactive
   (list (read-string "Regexp: " nil 'guix-search-history)))
  (or params (setq params guix-search-params))
  (guix-list-get-show-packages 'regexp regexp params))
