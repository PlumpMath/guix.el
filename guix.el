;;; Commentary:

;; This package is under development.  The goal is to make a
;; full-featured Emacs interface for Guix package manager
;; <http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/>.

;; Currently this package provides an interface for searching, listing
;; and getting information about Guix packages and generations.

;; To install this package, add the following to your init-file:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/guix-dir")
;;   (autoload 'guix-search-by-name "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-search-by-regexp "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-installed-packages "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-obsolete-packages "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-all-available-packages "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-newest-available-packages "guix" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'guix-generations "guix" nil t)
