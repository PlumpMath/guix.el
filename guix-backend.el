;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides the code for interacting with Guile using Geiser.

;; By default (if `guix-use-guile-server' is non-nil) 2 Geiser REPLs are
;; started.  The main one (with "guile --listen" process) is used for
;; "interacting" with a user - for showing a progress of
;; installing/deleting Guix packages.  The second (internal) REPL is
;; used for synchronous evaluating, e.g. when information about
;; packages/generations should be received for a list/info buffer.
;;
;; This "2 REPLs concept" makes it possible to have a running process of
;; installing/deleting packages and to continue to search/list/get info
;; about other packages at the same time.  If you prefer to use a single
;; Guix REPL, do not try to receive any information while there is a
;; running code in the REPL (see
;; <https://github.com/jaor/geiser/issues/28>).
;;
;; If you need to use "guix.el" in another Emacs (i.e. when there is
;; a runnig "guile --listen..." REPL somewhere), you can either change
;; `guix-default-port' in that Emacs instance or set
;; `guix-use-guile-server' to t.
;;
;; Guix REPLs (unlike the usual Geiser REPLs) are not added to
;; `geiser-repl--repls' variable, and thus cannot be used for evaluating
;; while editing scm-files.  The only purpose of Guix REPLs is to be an
;; intermediate between "Guix/Guile level" and "Emacs interface level".
;; That being said you can still want to use a Guix REPL while hacking
;; auxiliary scheme-files for "guix.el".  You can just use "M-x
;; connect-to-guile" (connect to "localhost" and `guix-default-port') to
;; have a usual Geiser REPL with all stuff defined by "guix.el" package.
